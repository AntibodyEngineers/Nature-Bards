## Overview
This project explores protein sequences found in nanobodies and translates it into music!

### Goals
1. Learn about nanobodies and their sequences.
2. Explore existing databases such as SabDab and Echinobase to extract protein sequences.
3. Analyze musical patterns to potentially design proteins,


### Outcomes
1. Understand
