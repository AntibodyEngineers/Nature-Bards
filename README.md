## Overview üí≠
This project blends **bioinformatics** and **music**, using sonification techniqus to analyze and design nanobody sequences.  


### Goals üéØ
1. Learn about nanobodies and their sequences.
2. Explore existing databases such as **SabDab** and **Echinobase** to extract protein sequences.
3. Translate amino acid sequences into musical notes.
4. Analyze musical patterns to potentially design proteins.


### Outcomes üéâ
1. Translated amino acid sequences into musical notes

## Tools & Software üõ†Ô∏è
  - Colab Notebook / Jypter Notebook
  - Python for sequence to sound mapping
  - MIDI/WAV file export
  - MuseScore (music notation)
  - SabDab (Structural Antibody Database)
  - Echinobase (Marine Proteins)
    

## User Guide üìù

1. **Run the notebook**  
   Open the provided `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. 
   Execute the cells to convert nanobody amino acid sequences into MIDI files.

3. **Output files**  
   The program generates:  
   - `.mid` (MIDI) files ‚Äî digital music files playable by most media players  

4. **Editing and playback**  
   Use free software like [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) to:  
   - Open and edit the MIDI files  
   - Play back the sonified sequences for auditory analysis  
   - Export audio or sheet music as needed

---

*Feel free to modify the notebook and mapping rules to explore different sonification schemes!*


## Future Ideas üí°
- Modify the code to accept **user input sequences** dynamically, so users don't have to edit the code for every run.  
- Add features to export additional audio formats (e.g., WAV).  
- Integrate pattern recognition tools to automate motif discovery from sonified data.
